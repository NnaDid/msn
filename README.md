# THE MISSIONARY SERVANTS OF THE NEEDY (MSN) 
## (Serving the Poor and the Less Privileged) 

# About Us:
The Missionary Servants of the Needy (MSN) is a Roman Catholic male religious association founded exclusively to help the poor and serve their needs. Anyone who wishes to participate in this so divinely motivated mission must inculcate a burning desire for working with the most disadvantaged members of society. He must see the priesthood of Jesus Christ and apostolic life from the perspective of service, not acquisition of honor and/or wealth.
Our mission is primarily centered on our special concern for the poor and the less privileged, especially those who are given little or zero attention in their immediate communities. Our mission is to help this class of people reinstate their sense of value and become more cognizant of their relevance to human society, to themselves, their families, and to God. Making visible and practical God’s Love and Mercy through Works of Charity and Corporal Works of Mercy is the major ingredient of our mission. Our utmost and ever-burning desire is to be the mouthpiece of God and "another Christ" to the poor and less-privileged.
Christ, on different occasions, in the scripture, identifies ceaselessly with the poor and the neglected ones, and shows unquantifiable and relentless concern for their wellbeing. For instance, in Matthew 14:13-21, 15:32-38; Mark 6:32-44; Luke 9:10-17, John 6:1-13, and some other similar passages in the scripture, Jesus’ compassionate concern for the hungry is astoundingly obvious. These texts unanimously highlight how Our Lord Jesus Christ, moved with love, compassion, and mercy, attended to the needs of the hungry. Imitating zealously and relentlessly Jesus’ compassionate attitude towards the hungry, we endeavor to pay uninterrupted attention to the needs of the poor. We want to be “another Christ” to them, be their brothers and friends and the channel through which they can encounter God’s love. The Word of God and the rich sacraments and tradition of the Church are the very summit of our spirituality.

## Our Mission/Charism:
Fundamental Charism: Our fundamental mission or charism is to seek to sanctify ourselves as priests of apostolic life by conforming our priestly life to the priesthood of Jesus Christ, in a mission of shared charity according to the norms of our Constitutions and apostolate, thereby fulfilling the original intention of Christ to save the greatest number of souls and paying an uninterrupted attention to the needs of the poor and the less-privileged.

In summary, our charism is summed up in our mission statement: To live the Holy Priesthood of Jesus Christ in sanctity, seeking to save souls by being of service to the poor and underprivileged. Jesus drew near and spoke to them saying: “All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you, and behold, I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world” (Matthew 28:16-20). Our mission then is to fulfill this original intention of Christ, and to do everything possible for the salvation of the greatest number of souls.

## Our Spiritual Mission: 
In fulfilling the mission entrusted to us by Christ, we are committed to intense prayers and meditation. We believe that praying together will enhance our spiritual bonding as brothers aiming at the same mission. We are committed to praying for ourselves and the entire faithful worldwide, especially the poor and the needy that we serve. Prayer is therefore the primary ingredient of our day. We strive to become an apostolic society in which we support each other and all other priests and religious as we work together as a theme to fulfill our mission. Our study, our prayer, and our community life are all focused on our mission to be servants of humanity. We stress the universal call to holiness and help people to open themselves to contemplation.
